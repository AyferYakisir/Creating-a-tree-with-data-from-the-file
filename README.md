# Creating-a-tree-with-data-from-the-file
This C++ program demonstrates the use of a binary search tree to store and manipulate city codes and names. It reads city codes and names from a file, builds a binary search tree based on the codes, and performs various operations on the tree.

## Features
- Adding nodes to the binary search tree based on city codes
- Traversing the tree in pre-order, in-order, and post-order
- Calculating the depth of the tree
- Checking if the tree is balanced
- Searching for a city name based on a given city code
- Calculating the level difference between two nodes in the tree
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler
### Running the Program
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Make sure the input file `city_codes.txt` is in the same directory as the compiled executable.
4. Run the executable.
## Usage
Upon running the program, it performs the following steps:

1. Reads the city codes and names from the input file.
2. Builds a binary search tree based on the city codes.
3. Displays the depth of the tree and checks if it is balanced.
4. Prints the tree in a hierarchical structure.
5. Prompts the user to enter two city codes.
6. Displays the corresponding city names for the given codes.
7. Calculates the level difference between the two nodes in the tree.
8. Displays the tree traversal in pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
